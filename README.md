# security-configs

This is the repository where we keep security related configuration files that
for some reason or other need to be publicly accessible. For example, Github
Actions will not run on public repositories if stored in a private one. We can
keep them here.

**Reminder**: This repository is public and any changes you make, and even the
ones you don't (i.e. a pull request that doesn't get merged) will be visible to
people outside the company. Pull request descriptions, comments, links, etc are
all going to be visible to strangers! ðŸ”®
